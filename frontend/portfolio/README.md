ðŸŸ¡ Skills

âš¡Skill-Project-Certificate Relationship

> Each Skill can reference multiple Projects and Certificates via their \_ids in MongoDB.
> On the frontend, Skill cards display linked Projects and Certificates as clickable links.
> Clicking a link redirects the user to the respective Project or Certificate detail page, which fetches full data using the referenced \_id.
> This approach keeps Skill documents lightweight and ensures that updates in Projects or Certificates are reflected dynamically across the app.
> Backend APIs for fetching single Project or Certificate are used to populate the detail pages.
