Q: What is MongoDB populate?
MongoDB is a document-oriented database, and in certain scenarios, it is beneficial to establish relationships between documents stored in different collections. The populate in mongoDB allows you to resolve these relationships by fetching and integrating related data from other collections into a single query result.2

🧩 What is Multer?

Multer is a Node.js middleware used with Express to handle file uploads — especially when the form data includes files (like images).
When a user submits a form that includes multipart/form-data (for example, an image upload), Express alone can’t handle that type of data — that’s where Multer comes in.

⚙️ What Multer Does

> Think of Multer as a middleman that:
> Parses incoming form-data requests that contain files.
> Saves those files temporarily (either in memory or on disk).
> Adds file info to req.file or req.files so your controller can access them.
